# Automating-Job-Search-and-Applications-with-LinkedIn-n8n

I’m excited to share that I have successfully built my first automated workflow that streamlines the entire job application process—from searching relevant jobs on LinkedIn to generating tailored cover letters and creating draft job application.

Using n8n, an open-source workflow automation tool, I created a system that:

  ⦁	Pulls job listings from LinkedIn via a custom RSS feed
  
  ⦁	Rates job matches based on my resume using AI (GPT-4O-MINI)
  
  ⦁	Generates personalized cover letters for each job posting using AI (GPT-4O-MINI)
  
  ⦁	Rate each job based on how relevant to applicant's skills
  
  ⦁	Logs and manages applications efficiently in Google Sheets
  
  ⦁	Create draft mail for each job

This automation saves countless hours of manual work and ensures I focus only on the most relevant opportunities. It’s beginner-friendly, scalable, and customizable for any job search.

I am eager to further develop and enhance this project, adding more features and improving its capabilities. Looking forward to exploring new possibilities and making this automation even more powerful!
